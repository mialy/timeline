Time-Line
-----------

### Description:
Time-Line is simple Python/Qt4-based application, that record spend hours
for different projects, into SQLite3 database.

However, the Time-Line doesn't show the recorded times, yet. So, for now
you should open and query the database by yourself. Maybe, in the future,
I will add that functionality...
